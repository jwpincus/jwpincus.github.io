<H1>WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA OR MESSAGES YOU SEND TO YOUR CONTACTS. PERIOD.</H1>

<p>
We physically can’t.  We have nowhere to store it.  We don’t even have a server database to store it.  So even if Justin Truedeau asked nicely in english and french to see your data, we wouldn’t have anything to show him.
