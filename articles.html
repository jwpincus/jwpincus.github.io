    <h2>A word to future Turing students</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Right now you know very little in comparison to almost everyone else in the building. That's nothing to worry about. It is actually an asset, because is means that you can grab almost anyone, and they will know how to answer your questions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Get over your ego. You might not be used to struggling or asking for help. Don't be embarassed about asking about something you don't understand. People like to help. People want to help. People will not think you are dumb for asking.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lot of these advice pieces from the upper mods sound scary. Don't feel overwhelmed. Each day taken on its own is very manageable, and you'll be fine. Really.
